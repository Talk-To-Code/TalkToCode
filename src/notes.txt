input into the parser:

list of struct commands.

"#c_program SampleProgram", "#include "stdio h";;",
<code>, " #program_end"

E.G.:
#c_program SampleProgram #include "stdio h";; #create int #variable count #value 5 #dec_end;; #program_end


As of now, cannot parse integer array with assignment.
e.g. int mark[5] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9}


#c_program SampleProgram #include "stdio h";; #create int #variable hello #value 5 #dec_end;;
for #condition #assign #variable I #with #value 0 #condition #variable is < #value 5 #condition #post #variable I ++ #for_start
#create int #variable first #value 0 #dec_end;;
#for_end;; 
#program_end

todo:
need to improve undo command.
make if statement an extendable block. not sure how it will happen but yea
dot, underscore naming.
make cursor obvious - like a comment that says cursor??
make it work with symbol. like ambersand or percent
segmenter needs to do more thorough checks. maybe include another else if condition for failed parsing.
if not parseable, dont bother bro. just remove latest command and clear the codeBuffer;
