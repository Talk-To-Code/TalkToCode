input into the parser:

list of struct commands.

"#c_program SampleProgram", "#include "stdio h";;",
<code>, " #program_end"

E.G.:
#c_program SampleProgram #include "stdio h";; #create int #variable count #value 5 #dec_end;; #program_end


As of now, cannot parse integer array with assignment.
e.g. int mark[5] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9}

assign case:
are you assigning number, string or variable?? This is tricky


#c_program SampleProgram #include "stdio h";; #create int #variable hello #value 5 #dec_end;;
for #condition #assign #variable I #with #value 0 #condition #variable is < #value 5 #condition #post #variable I ++ #for_start
#create int #variable first #value 0 #dec_end;;
#for_end;; 
#program_end

todo:
assign statement needs to check if variable already exists.
need to take another look at the extendable/go ahead feature.
need to improve undo command.
else block to be implemented.
array assignment not sure if done.
