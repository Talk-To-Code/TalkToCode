input into the parser:

list of struct commands.

"#c_program SampleProgram", "#include "stdio h";;",
<code>, " #program_end"

E.G.:
#c_program SampleProgram #include "stdio h";; #create int #variable count #value 5 #dec_end;; #program_end


As of now, cannot parse integer array with assignment.
e.g. int mark[5] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9}

assign case:
are you assigning number, string or variable?? This is tricky

Block statements:
Seems like ast parser requires blocks to be completed. This fucking sucks.
Seems like i will have to import everything each time. hais oh well.
