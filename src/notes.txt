input into the parser:

list of struct commands.

"#c_program SampleProgram", "#include #access stdio h #access_end;;",
<code>, " #program_end"


#c_program SampleProgram #include #access stdio h #access_end;;
#create int #variable count #value 5 #dec_end;; #program_end

<code> e.g. = "#create int #variable count #value 5 #dec_end;;",
"#assign #variable count #with #value 5 + #value 6;;"


As of now, cannot parse integer array with assignment.
e.g. int mark[5] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9}

assign case:

are you assigning number, string or variable?? This is tricky

Block statements:
Seems like ast parser requires blocks to be completed. This fucking sucks.
Seems like i will have to import everything each time. hais oh well.

should port over variable_types from text2struct to clean_text.
Also should consider if compress name is a clean_text function or not.
Feels like it should.

As of now, should port over all functionality first before considering it.
Compress name is a standalone function so it can be easily ported.
