input into the parser:

list of struct commands.

"#c_program SampleProgram", "#include "stdio.h";;", <code>, " #program_end"

As of now, cannot parse integer array with assignment.
e.g. int mark[5] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9}


#c_program SampleProgram #include "stdio h";; #create int #variable hello #value 5 #dec_end;;
for #condition #assign #variable I #with #value 0 #condition #variable is < #value 5 #condition #post #variable I ++ #for_start
#create int #variable first #value 0 #dec_end;;
#for_end;; 
#program_end

todo:
edit speech hist
- undo of exit block is enter block.

Make an Edit stack 
- stores vital info to undo edit commands.
- make this its own class along with undo.

struct_command_manager
- have its own manuevering commands - go left, right, up, down.

make infix segmenter.
brackets for if block - "group" command, go left and go right.

maybe add a spelling command.
