input into the parser:

list of struct commands.

"#c_program SampleProgram", "#include #access stdio h #access_end;;",
<code>, " #program_end"

<code> e.g. = "#create int #variable count #value 5 #dec_end;;",
"#assign #variable count #with #value 5 + #value 6;;"


As of now, cannot parse integer array with assignment.
e.g. int mark[5] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9}

assign case:

are you assigning number, string or variable?? This is tricky
